Simple web project that made for e-channeling.
This project helps a certain medical establishment such as a clinic or a hospital clients/clients to request an appointment with a lawyer online. This project can also help lawyers to manage the schedules of their appointments with their clients. This lawyer's appointment system will organize the schedules of each client's appointment, which will be submitted as a request to the lawyer they have selected. The system has 3 sides which are the administrator, the lawyer, and the client. The system admin will populate the list of the lawyers with their specialties and along with the lawyer's details and system credentials. The clients will browse the lawyer's appointment system website to find a lawyer that has the specialty of their needs. The client can check the lawyer's weekly schedule to help them to choose the day and time which they can comply for the appointment and they will submit their request for an appointment. After that, the lawyers can view all their appointments and the appointment request of the clients for their availability.
